encodeURIComponent for Ruby
=======================

A port of V8's URIEncodeComponent to Ruby.

Based on `r11482` of V8's [SVN repository](https://code.google.com/p/v8/wiki/Source).

# Why use this?

* There's no other complete implementation of JavaScript's encodeURIComponent for Ruby that I'm aware of.
* Based on the excellent V8 code used in Chrome.
